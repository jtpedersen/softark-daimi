Build-management
================

In this exercise I took the liberty to make some 'obvious
implementation' and proceeded with somewhat larger steps.

My process was:

Iteration 1
-----------

A) make the folder structure as described
B) move the exercise skeleton code fragments into their proper places
C) update the package statements in all
D) ensure that the provided Ant compilation targets worked.
This was the first green bar.

Iteration 2
-----------
The next iteration was to make the test targets in Ant. This was quite
easy by copying from the pay station example.

Iteration 3
-----------
The final iteration was to move all my existing solution code from the
betamon exercise into place. 

A) I decided that GameImpl and
MoveValidationStrategy should go to the domain package (as these are
not variant specific implementation) and move
AlphamonValidationStrategy, BetamonValidationStratetgy, and
StandardBoard to the variant package. All tests however, I put in the
domain package as the proliferation of classes is expected to be much
smaller in the test folder hierarchy.

B) Next I introduce all the package and import statements, using the
build-all target to drive this process until everything compiles ok.

C) Finally I run both testing targets and verify that the same number
of tests are run as in the previous exercise.

Green.

Iteration 4
-----------

I run the make-doc and browse the docs. I find a documentation defect,
namely that StandardBoard's JavaDoc comment has missed a * which means
it does not properly show in the generated javadoc. I fix it and is
done.
